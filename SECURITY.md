# Reporting Security Issues

The OfficialEye project and community take security bugs very seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/ZeroBone/OfficialEye/security/advisories/new) tab.

If the crucial part of the code you are concerned about is third-party library code, we kindly ask you to report the issue to the respective project maintainer and, if possible, link the two security issues together.
