# A Smart Document Recognition System

OfficialEye is a perfect solution if you need to reliably extract important information from an official document (e.g. passport or certificate) based on its image. The tool relies on modern AI to transform the original image to a standartized canonical form, where it is easy to extract and process any information you need. The key features of the system can be summarized as follows.

## Example-driven and Easy to Use

All you need to do is to provide OfficialEye with an example of a document you would like to recognize, and then explain which regions contain document-specific information you are interested in, and which can be used to match the given image with the example.

## Extremely Modular and Customizable

The recognition system is split into three components that are independent of each other and that can be combined flexibly without having to rebuild the tool.
